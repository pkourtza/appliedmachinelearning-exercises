# Applied Machine Learning Exercises

A series of exercises on machine learning methods, completed as part of a postgraduate course.

AppliedMachineLearning1: 
- includes exercises on linear regression and Naive Bayes classification methods. 
- Uses house pricing data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market 
- and income data from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

AppliedMachineLearning2: 
- includes exercises on data analysis and preprocessing methods, PCA for dimensionality reduction, clustering methods (k-means and hierarchical), logistic regression and Support Vector Machines for classification, classification evaluation methods (accuracy score, F1, log-likelihood), Gaussian Mixture Models. 
- Uses the EMNIST handwritten character dataset from: https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset 
- and a subset of the Human Activity Recognition data set (UniMiB SHAR) from: http://www.sal.disco.unimib.it/technologies/unimib-shar/
